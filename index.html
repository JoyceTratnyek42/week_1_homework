    <h1>Joyce's Homepage</h1>
      
      
    <h1>1: Describe your previous experience with coding. What classes have you taken where you were exposed to HTML/CSS/JS? What parts of the class resonated with you? Which parts were the most confusing?</h1>
    <p>Aside from occasionally doing code.org in 4th grade tech class, the only experience I have with coding is Core 1: Interaction. Not to come off as shady or rude, but I didn't learn much from that class, due to the teacher being very inexpeirenced. The most confusing part of the class was javascript, which we went over briefly but I still didn't understand. A lot of our content was rushed (which was partly due to the strike.) We covered how to make websites responsive, but I forgot how to do that. One thing my teacher was exceptionally unskilled at was explaining to us the "why" of his actions, so I spent most of my class sessions hurridly copying down his code and leaving feeling more and more lost as the semester went on. The part that resonated with me the most was the basic structure of HTML. I think of it like a skeleton for the rest of coding, and it always gives me a comfotrable starting point. </p>
      
      
    <h1>2: How are you feeling about learning to code in this class? Nervous? Excited?</h1>
      <p>I mostly feel excited to learn more coding. During the times that I worked on coding last semester, I found that I actually enjoyed it once I got into a focused, flow state. I think it was just my lack of confidence with it that made me anxious to start working on coding projects. I think web design is one of the most interesting and practical expressions of my lvoe for graphic design. I have my own personal website for my art that I made using an online template, and I think it would be a fun challenge to polish it and make it truly unique and beautiful with coding, beyond the limitations of my chosen template <a href="https://joycetratnyek.com"> Here</a> it is, if you are curious. </p>
      
     <h1>3: How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?</h1>
      <p>I really hope that I can become a decent web designer after college, at the very least good enough to implement simple ideas and get a job doing that, possibly as an asisstant to a more experienced programmer. I really want to design creative websites for musical artists like myself, that is one of my greatest passions. I also think it might be fun to design more e-commerce websites, especially the indie/alt ones. At the very least, I want to be able to use coding to edit small details and polish websites that are made using templates, like the one I mentioned above. </p>
      
      <h1>4: Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Which one(s) are required to create a webpage?</h1>
      
      <p>You can create a basic website with just html or html and css, but all three are used for most modern, profesisonal websites. HTML mostly lays out the skeleton of a website's content through text and simple styling. CSS adds more styling and personalization, and JS adds the website's dynamics and interactivity, allowing it to respond to input from users, so it is no longer static until manually updated. </p>
      
      <h1>5: Describe what GitHub does.</h1>
      
      <p>GitHub lets you host files of code on the GitHub server, where they can be publicly accessed using an actual URL, isntead of just sitting on your hard drive. You can upload copies and version of a git repository, to work on websites while archiving all past versions of your work. It also supports collabroation on coding projects</p>
      
      <h1>6: Using each HTML heading tags (<!--<h1> → <h6>-->), list your favorite foods in order of preference.</h1>

      <h2>Kimchi with Rice</h2>
      <h3>Fruit Smoothie</h3>

      <h1> 7: Create an unordered list (<!--<ul>-->) and link 3 of your favorite graphic design or development-related websites. Within each list item, write a paragraph describing why the site is important or useful to you.</h1>
      
              <ul>
          <li>Pinterest <p>This may be a basic answer, and it includes not *just* graphic design or coding, but I love pinterest. It is my first stop for inspiration when I start any creative project. Sometimes, if I don't have anything else to do, I will just scroll through it for hours. I love how the algorithm tailors my homepage posts to my style and interests, but I can search for anything at all. I love the sheer variety of STUFF on pinterest; it has so many possibilities.</p></li>
          <li>AIGA Eye on Design <p>This website has a very simple, yet iconic design, which is something that inspires me. I especially enjoy their specific sections and columns, such as "design + music" (which is my biggest passion aside from design), design history 101, satire, and their city guides. It makes for entertaining and educational browsing, and it's clear that the site was made by deisngers for designers, which makes me feel at home. </p></li>
          <li>Printed Matter <p>This is a company that sells books, zines, and other forms of mostly independent media. I strive to take in inspiration from both big-name, corporate, and indie designers and orgs. I've been to the physical PM shop, which is pretty close to my dorm, and is and overwhelmingly cool and inspiring space to explore and get lost in, much more so than the website. I even submitted a zine I deisgned to them, but got rejected. Oh well, I guess.</p></li>

<h1>13: Create a square on the page with a 3-color gradient applied to it.  To do this:
    1. Use the code snippet at the bottom of this page to create an empty box with a class name `my-box`.<br>
    2. Use the CSS Gradient website to create a gradient with 3 colors.  Copy the generated CSS code.<br>
    3. Add a CSS rule that targets the box element (hint: `.my-box` ) and paste in the CSS code for the background.<br></h1>
        
<div class="my-box" style="height: 500px; width: 500px; border: 1px solid"></div>
        

<h1>14: Go back to the CSS gradient website.  Drag the color slider around and see how the generated CSS changes.  Move the position handles for each color and do the same.  Describe how the generated CSS changes in response to these changes.  Can you figure out how a gradient is defined in CSS?</h1>
        
<p>The three parts of the 2nd "background" parameter define the numeric color values of each point in red, green, blue, and transparent parameters. The percentage at the end of each part refers to when in the overall gradient that specific color point hits, so my three are set to 0%, 50% and 100%. Changing these would control how much space each color point takes up in the overall gradient. </p>
        
<h1>15: Describe in words how you would like to style this homepage to reflect your personal design sensibilities.</h1>
        
<p>Recently I've been very obsessed with dark, grungy, indie design aesthetics. I would probably use a black background and white or red text in an elegant, unique serif font for the headings, and probably a sans font for the body text. I might try a collage-inspired aesthetic, with layering some page elements on top of ripped paper images or "ripped" photos. Or possibly I might use word-collage-style lettering for the headings and even some of the body text. I think it would be fun to try and add lots of small SVG graphics as visual accents, such as stars, circles, or hearts. </p>
        
<h1>16: Use your CSS knowledge to apply as much of this styling as possible.  Are there styling changes that you want to make but don’t know how to? What are they?</h1>
        
<p>Here is some basic css styling based on what I remember from last term, which isn't much. One thing I still really don't understand is how to use fonts, esepcially custom or unique fonts, in CSS. </p>
